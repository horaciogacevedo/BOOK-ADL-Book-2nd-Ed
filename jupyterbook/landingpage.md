# Modern Theory of Machine Learning



## Adding a citation

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreoever, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

````
```{bibliography} references.bib
```
````

Resulting in a rendered bibliography that looks like:

```{bibliography} references.bib
```


## Executing code in your markdown files

If you'd like to include computational content inside these markdown files,
you can use MyST Markdown to define cells that will be executed when your
book is built. Jupyter Book uses *jupytext* to do this.

First, add Jupytext metadata to the file. For example, to add Jupytext metadata
to this markdown page, run this command:

```
jupyter-book myst init markdown.md
```

Once a markdown file has Jupytext metadata in it, you can add the following
directive to run the code at build time:

````
```{code-cell}
print("Here is some code to execute")
```
````

When your book is built, the contents of any `{code-cell}` blocks will be
executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
in-line with the rest of your content.

For more information about executing computational content with Jupyter Book,
see [The MyST-NB documentation](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/).
