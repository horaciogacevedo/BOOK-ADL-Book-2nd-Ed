# ADL-Book-2nd-Ed
Github repository for the second edition of the ADL Book.

## Jupyter Book

To get all notebooks together in an easy online version we use [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). In this way the entire set of notebooks will become a browasable online book that will be accessible to everyone.

On the top right of each page you will always find several icons that will allow you to download all the files, access the github repository or open a notebook in colab.
